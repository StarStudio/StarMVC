# StarMVC

A small Front-end MVC framework writen by pure javascript.

This project starts for the new-comer of StarStudio, as an introduction to "How Front-end MVC framework works".

You can see a simple SPA using StarMVC in the example directory, and the core of StarMVC is in the lib.

At now there is only two methods that you can use, you can find the usage in the example code.

The document of our project is [here](https://github.com/StarStudio/StarMVC/wiki)!
